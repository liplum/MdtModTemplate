# Mindustry Mod Template
___
</div>

This template utilized [MGPP gradle plugin](https://plumygame.github.io/mgpp/) to build and debug a mod.

Every push with a message containing `[release]` will create a release draft on GitHub.

It's recommended to `watch` this project, which will notify you anything updated of the template.

You can select which `Gradle DSL` to use, by easily deleting `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`.
If you kept both, it would use `build.gradle` as default.
